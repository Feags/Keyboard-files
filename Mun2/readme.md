## M端n 2
The M端n 2 is the successor to the original M端n keyboard kit. The PCB has hotswap MX sockets with RGB backlight, 2x RP2040 microcontrollers, all-USB-C and ESD protection. An internal cable is provided to connect the PCBs together for certain 60% cases. You will need 70 switches, keycaps, and USB-C cables to complete a keyboard.

All files are provided on an as is basis. No guarantees or warranties are given or implied.

The split case has a few variants:
 * Aluminum: 19mm thickness
 * 3D Print: 15, 17, and 19mm thickness
Each half of the case uses two identical frame parts, one top and one bottom. The 3D print files include a "Top" model with the USB ports removed. They are provided with no shrink compensation, you will need to apply a scaling factor (something close to 100.5% for PLA) in order to get the parts to fit properly. Magnets and steel plates are used to secure the case together. Three case thicknesses are available using the following stackups:
