# MÃ¼n files
* Case and assembly files.
* Plate DXF files should use 1.5mm thickness.
* To order prints of the rubber mounts, use "Bumper-x8.STEP", as larger single prints tend to be cheaper than 8x small prints.
* PCB Should be 1.6mm thickness, and has 14x countersunk holes noted in the "PCB Countersinks.STEP" file.
